# SnakesAndLaddersFinalProj
Sarah &amp; Katarina's final project for Network Programming, Spring 2019

## **Description**
### What?
A virtual version of the popular game Snakes and Ladders that can be played by 2 or more people
### Why?
It is fun to play board games, and this way, people could play together even if they are not right next to eachother.
### How?
Our GUI will be a simple grid layout with a shape or image for each player moving in accordance with the results of a dice simulation. We will use client-server architechture with a central server to maintain the game data and communicate with each player.

## **Deliverables**
1. game frontend
2. game backend
3. documentation

## **Plan**
* Week 1: come up with idea and think through implementation
